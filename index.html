  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu.  Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe.  So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices.  The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days.  Be sure  to book in advance to avoid disappointments.  On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" This palace is a five-story pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m). The top three floors of the structure have the width of a single room, while the first and second floors have patios in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique façade. The inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor. The interior of the palace has been described as "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding; while fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard".</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" > As scientists and the medical community across the world are struggling to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, they are continuously learning something new about it. One of the mysteries of the novel coronavirus- SARS-CoV-2, according to experts, is that it causes only mild to moderate symptoms in most people but turns out to be fatal for others causing multiple organ failure and even death. The answer to this mystery, according to experts, could lie in the emerging evidence that in many cases, severe COVID-19 may be driven by an overreaction of their immune systems against the infection where the body starts to attack its own cells and tissues, rather than the virus itself. This abnormal immune response to the infection is called ‘cytokine storm’, which experts say, is one of the fuelling agents of COVID-19..</p>
